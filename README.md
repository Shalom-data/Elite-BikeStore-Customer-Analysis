- Grouping age into categories:
  - Young Adults (25-39)
  - Middle-Aged (40-54)
  - Older Adults (55-69)
  - Seniors (70+)
- Grouping income into three categories: Low, Medium, High.
- Creating pivot tables to analyze various dimensions such as age, income, and purchase status.


## Analysis
#### Age Group Segmentation

- The customers were segmented into four age groups: Young Adults (25-39), Middle-Aged (40-54), Older Adults (55-69), and Seniors (70+).
- Pivot tables were used to determine the total bike purchases by each age group.
  
#### Income Segmentation
- Income was grouped into three categories: Low, Medium, and High.
- Analyzed the relationship between income levels and bike purchases.

#### Purchase Analysis
- Examined the proportion of customers who purchased bikes versus those who didn’t.
- Analyzed additional variables like gender, marital status, car ownership, and commute distance to identify potential trends.

  
## Key Insights

1. #### INCOME & PURCHASING BEHAVIOUR

- Marital Status: Married customers have an average income that is 10% higher than single customers.
- Gender: Male customers earn 6% more on average than female customers.
- Buyer vs. Non-Buyer Income: Buyers have an average income that is 6% higher than non-buyers.

##### ACTIONABALE RECOMMENDATION:
Focus on marketing to married and higher-income customers to boost revenue through premium offerings or exclusive packages.

2. #### AGE GROUPS & PURCHASE TRENDS

- Young Adults (25-39) and Middle-aged (40-54) account for 88% of bike purchases (422 out of 481 buyers).
- Despite earning less on average, Young Adults (25-39) lead in purchases.
- Middle-aged customers (40-54) have the highest income but also show strong purchase behavior.

##### ACTIONABALE RECOMMENDATION:
- The Young Adults (25-39) group should be a key focus, even though they have lower incomes. Affordable models, installment plans, or targeted promotions might appeal to this group.
 
- The Middle-Aged (40-54) group represents a high-income, high-purchase segment. Offering premium models or bundling products like accessories or maintenance services could resonate with this group.
 
- Older Adults (55-69) and Seniors (70+) may require a different approach. Offering e-bikes, or promoting health benefits and comfort-related features, might attract more purchases from these age groups.
